This project is private but if you've happened to have stumbled here feel free to snoop.

## Optimizations
The more optimized it is the more simulations can be run so please optimize!

Any functions that are called during Monte Carlo simulations will use a lot of resources. Optimization of these functions is a priority and eventually complete c implementations of these functions will be preferred.
